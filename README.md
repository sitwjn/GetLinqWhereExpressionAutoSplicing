# GetLinqWhereExpressionAutoSplicing
To get linq where expression auto-splicing by if condition

I found that we can get where condition expression for linq through a method which can fit most scene of coding with c#.

When we were not sure how many condition is shoud be spliced in where expression of linq, we should wrote many linq expression for different situations.

But now, I think we can splice where conditions for linq like splice them for SQL, if use this method.

Hope it can help you.
